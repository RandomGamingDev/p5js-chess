# p5js-chess
A basic implementation of chess made for p5.js

Draw's aren't implemented yet and you just won't be able to move when you get checkmated or stalemated, but other than that it's just the classic game of chess.

The chess pieces are from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces and created by User:Cburnett
